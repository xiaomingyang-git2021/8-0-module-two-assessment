## Assessment Details

Create an app using the [Studio Ghibli API](https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/#) that allows users to view and review each movie.

This app should have (in order of placement in the HTML):

- An image of the [Studio Ghibli logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/ca/Studio_Ghibli_logo.svg/1200px-Studio_Ghibli_logo.svg.png)
- A header (`h1`) that reads "Ghibli Review App"
- A `select` box that contains the title of each movie available in the API, as well as a default blank selection
- A `section`, empty of text and with the id `display-info`, that will contain the title (`h3`), release year (`p`), and description (`p`) of the selected film.
- A `form`, including a "text" `input` and a "submit" `input`, that allows users to submit (not save, just add to the frontend) a review of that film. On submission the input should clear.
- A `ul` underneath that `form` that should contain the submitted reviews of each film.

Please feel free to include additional `sections`s and elements if they make styling the application easier.

The user should be able to:

- Use the `select` box to select a specific film. When they select a film, information about that film (title, release year, description) should populate in the `display-info` section below. When they select a different film, this information should be replaced.
- Use the `form`, below the movie information, to submit a review. Each review should be a new `li`, with the selected film's title (in bold) and a review body (not bold).

## Styling

Assume default styling unless explicitly articulated here. **Do not** utilize CSS Reset.

Your website should be responsive and work on screens of different sizes.

- **Body**
  - Monospace font for all text (inputs excepted - default is fine).
  - `lavender` background color.
  - Arrange content in a column, centered on the page width-wise.
- **Header**
  - Header should contain the `image` and `h1` tags.
  - Width: 70 percent. Height: 150px.
  - Image and header text should be horizontally oriented.
  - Image and header text should be on opposite sides of the header. Vertically, they should both be positioned in the center of their containing `div`.
  - Image should have the same height as the header (150px).
  - Header should have a margin of 30 pixels on the bottom and a padding of 10 pixels on all sides.
  - Header background color should be `skyblue`.
- **Main Area**
  - Main area should contain all other content on the page.
  - Width: 60 percent.
  - Content should be oriented in a column, justified left.
- **Review Text Input**
  - The `text` input should have an explicit `width` of 400 pixels.

Your app should end up looking something like this:
